Different methods that use chemicals or electroporation will get that plasmid into the yeast and change its DNA. As an organism designer, it’s your job to make sure the yeast is transformed the way you want!\n. <br> <br> Look at the circle to the top right. That is the plasmid that you will integrate into the yeast that you see on the top left. Look at the section of the page labeled “toolbox.” Right now, you see blocks that are labeled as different colors. These are called genes. Each gene codes for the color it is named after; if you put the “red” gene in one of the empty gene slots on the plasmid and press “Transform,” you will insert the plasmid with the red gene into the yeast. Give it a try!\n→ if fail: Drag and drop the box that says “red” to the empty slot on the plasmid. \n"
